# src/domain: the business rules

This folder holds the rules of Lease Loop as plain functions. Most of your
hackathon work belongs here.

## Rules for this folder

1. **Pure.** No database, no files, no network, no `process.env`, no framework imports.
   A function gets everything it needs as arguments and returns a value.
2. **Deterministic.** No `Date.now()`, `new Date()` or `Math.random()`. Dates come in as
   ISO strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) chosen by the caller. The same input always gives the same output.
3. **Money is integer cents.** `189900` means 1 899,00 €. Do not use floats for money, and
   decide on purpose where you round (and say so in a comment).
4. **Expected failures are values, not exceptions.** "This amount cannot be financed" is an
   answer the UI must show, so return a result such as
   `{ ok: false, reason: 'below_minimum' }`. Throw only for bugs (for example, a fraction of
   a cent).
5. **Every function has tests.** Put them next to the code (`pricing.ts` → `pricing.test.ts`)
   and test the edges: band limits, the first and last day of a date range, zero, empty lists.

ESLint enforces rules 1 and 2 for this folder (see `eslint.config.mjs`).

### How the question flow works

1. The UI keeps the customer's answers and calls `resolveFlow(questions, deal, answers)`
   after every change, including going back and changing an earlier answer.
2. It shows `next.question` (with `next.problem` as an inline error, for example a wrong
   business ID check digit), stores `answers` in place of its own, and shows a notice
   listing `removed` when answers were dropped because their question no longer applies.
3. `status: 'blocked'` means an answer stops the application (under 18, a country we do
   not lease to): no more questions are asked.
4. When `status` is `complete` or `blocked`, `decideApplication()` gives the outcome, the
   `reasons` for it and every `check`. It needs the monthly rent with VAT from pricing.

## What teams are expected to add

Create these as you need them. Do not commit empty files.

- `pricing`: monthly rent, down payment, VAT and the end-of-term buyout price.
- `question-flow`: which question to ask next, from `data/questions.json`, and what happens
  to answers that stop applying.
- `contract`: build the contract from an approved application and lock it so it cannot change.
- `invoicing`: the monthly invoices for a contract, including a VAT rate change mid-contract.
- `end-of-term`: return, buy out or extend, and the value of the returned item.
- `second-life`: refurbishment cost, matching a returned item to the waiting list, CO2 saved.

## Contract price lock

`contract-pricing.ts` selects the signing-date list and builds the snapshot using
`quoteLease()` from `pricing.ts`, the same calculation used by the sliders.
Contract pricing tests live alongside the unchanged quote tests.

Signing locks the net price from the catalogue valid on the signing date, rather
than preserving an earlier quote. If the displayed quote has become stale, the
signing API rejects it so the renter can refresh and review before consenting.
The stored contract includes the list price and version, coefficient identity and
version, band, factor, down payment, financed amount, monthly net rent, buyout,
signing date and term. Later catalogue or coefficient edits do not modify it.

The locked period starts on the saved customer-selected `startOn` (on or after
signing) and ends at the exclusive monthly anniversary
stored as `endOn`. Short months clamp to their last day. Each monthly net rent and
the buyout are rounded once to nearest whole euro cent, with half cents rounded up.
The net rental total is monthly net rent multiplied by the agreed number of months;
the down payment and optional buyout are separate amounts.

VAT is not locked. `invoicePrice` takes the stored monthly net rent and selects the
VAT rate by invoice date (inclusive validity boundaries), rounding tax once per
invoice to the nearest cent, half up. The contract page lets the renter compare
invoice dates; this date comparison previews tax only. The separate invoice list shows persisted invoices.

Signing uses `withAudit` to create the contract and reserve the available item in
one transaction. The public API reruns application eligibility and derives the
signer from approved answers. The name alone cannot authorise signing; customer
authentication remains outside this MVP.

Issue #45 saves the catalogue offer before the application, compares it with the
signing-date price and requires renewed consent for a changed offer. A company
contract remains provisional until its named signatory reviews and accepts the
current price. See [Persisted offers and signature price locks](../../docs/persisted-quotes.md).

## Monthly invoices

`invoices.ts` schedules exactly `termMonths` full rental invoices in advance.
The first invoice date and payment due date are the saved lease start date
(`startOn`), which may be later than signing. For a mid-month
start, the first period runs from that day to the next monthly anniversary: there
is no calendar-month proration or extra stub-period charge. Invoice date and due
date are deliberately identical; no additional payment grace period is assumed.

Each date is calculated from the original lease start day with `contractEndOn`,
clamping independently to the last day of each shorter month. A 31 January 2026
start bills on 28 February 2026, 31 March 2026 and 29 February 2028. The final
invoice precedes the exclusive contract end date.

Every net amount is the saved contract's locked monthly net rent, already rounded
at signing. The invoice net total is exactly rent × term. Down payment and optional
buyout are separate, excluded from rental invoices. VAT is selected using each
invoice date and rounded once per invoice to whole cents, half up; gross totals
sum those individual net and tax lines, never an independently rounded total.

The contract page's explicit generation button issues the entire schedule,
including future dated invoices, using the VAT table known at generation time.
Issued invoice amounts are immutable snapshots; future statutory changes would
need an explicit adjustment workflow outside this MVP. GET never issues invoices.
POST /api/contracts/[id]/invoices accepts a caller-supplied actor, matching the
starter's audit convention; it is not an authentication mechanism.
Generation uses one audited transaction and a database unique key on contract and
period. Retries return the same invoices; the audit records each successful
generation request, including retries. Missing VAT fails the whole generation.

## Rounding and total cost

Money is integer cents. Monthly rent is financed cents multiplied by the factor
represented in millionths, rounded once to the nearest cent with half cents up. A
dealer discount is rounded half up once against that rounded monthly net rent and
subtracted before VAT. VAT uses the invoice-date rate and is rounded half up once
per invoice; an invoice's gross is exactly `netCents + vatCents`. Never calculate tax
from an aggregate net total, because that can produce a different number of cents
than summing the individually rounded invoice taxes.

For a returned lease, the monthly rental totals are `Σ invoice.netCents`,
`Σ invoice.vatCents`, and `Σ invoice.grossCents`. Net rent totals exactly
`monthlyNetCents × termMonths`. Group the net, VAT and gross sums by each invoice's
`vatPercent` to show the VAT change without changing the locked rent. The quoted net
lease amount is `downPaymentCents + Σ invoice.netCents`; `quote.totalNetCents` uses
that definition and excludes VAT and buyout. The recorded cash total for the lease
is `downPaymentCents + Σ invoice.grossCents`, plus the buyout payment only if the
customer buys the item. Keep the down payment and buyout as separate lines. If a
buyout transaction is later implemented, it must add its own VAT at the purchase
date; it must not be counted as another monthly invoice. Do not add invoice gross
and then add those same invoices' net and VAT again.

See [Money Core verification and legacy recovery](../../docs/money-core-integration.md)
for start-date evidence, migration failure reproduction and the tested side-by-side
recovery approach.

## Circular impact: the CO2 estimate (illustrative)

`estimateRentalCo2Saving({ asset, termMonths, knownHistory, factors, wearPolicy, method })`
gives the renter a prospective estimate of CO2 saved by renting this item instead of buying
a new one. It is **illustrative**: the factors in `data/co2-factors.json` are fictional.

- **Formula** (method `prospective-circular-use` v1): new-item manufacturing × wear credit −
  new-item manufacturing × refurbishment share. No travel/car-displacement credit.
- **Wear credit** (`co2-wear.ts`, policy `residual-proxy` v1): condition multiplier ×
  (1 − capped usage penalty), copied from `residual-curves.json` as a price-derived proxy.
  Completed usage steps only. A counter reset adds known prior usage; unknown prior usage
  counts as the maximum penalty, never as zero.
- **First use** uses the same method (a prospective circular-use scenario); the method's
  `firstUse` setting is the one place to change that.
- **Units and rounding**: grams of CO2e and parts per million, integers only. Each component
  is rounded once to whole grams, half up; the saving is their exact difference. Zero and
  negative results are kept and shown as "no estimated saving" / "additional impact".
- **Versions**: every result carries its factor set, wear policy and method id/version.
  Replacing factors or the method means a new version; callers and UI do not change.
- The term is part of the interface but this method does not allocate impact by duration.

## Lease-end reminders

Defaults are 30, 7 and 1 calendar days before the lease ends, at 09:00 in the renter's
saved IANA time zone (Europe/Helsinki only as a fallback), through in-app and simulated
email. The deadline is 00:00 on the exclusive `endOn` in Helsinki, viewed in the
renter's zone; a reminder at or after it is rejected. A spring-gap time moves forward
by the gap; an autumn-fold time uses the earlier occurrence.

An occurrence's identity is lease + recipient + end-date version + rule ID + day
offset, so changing only the clock time or zone never resends a delivered reminder.
Reminders already past when settings are saved are not backfilled. Reminders missed
while the server was down become ONE catch-up notification per lease, worded with the
actual time left when it is generated; future thresholds stay scheduled.
Persistence, the worker and the simulated delivery live in `src/server/reminders/`.

## Related items

`rankRelatedItems(context, candidates, rules)` is a deterministic ruleset, not a model.
Hard checks run first: the viewed item, repeated ids, anything not `available`, anything
without a price on the same basis and anything over an optional monthly budget are left
out. Category affinity (an explicit matrix; unlisted pairs score the configured fallback,
0 = excluded), price similarity and condition each score 0–100 and are weighted by the
rules (default 70/25/5, four results). Equal scores are ordered by asset id.

Prices are compared on one basis only: `monthlyRentBasis`, the existing `quoteLease`
monthly net rent for the same term with no down payment. A list price is never compared
with a rent. Each result carries explanation codes for facts that actually hold.
Change `data/related-item-rules.json` to tune the ranking; no code changes are needed.

## Bundles

A bundle is a provider's grouping of at least two distinct physical assets with the terms
it can be leased for. `validateBundleDraft` reports every problem at once (duplicates,
unknown or foreign assets, unsupported terms). `bundleAvailability` derives bookability
from every component's current state: one reserved or returned component blocks the whole
bundle. Edits carry a revision (`nextBundleRevision`) so a stale edit is a conflict.
Bundles carry no prices yet, and signing a bundle as one lease is not implemented.

## Long-term discounts

`discounts.ts` validates dealer rule inputs and selects the greatest eligible
percentage (ties use the smallest rule ID; rules never stack). The shared
`quoteLease()` calculates original rent, discount and final rent in integer cents.
Only monthly net rent is discounted; down payment, financed amount and buyout are
unchanged. VAT is calculated after the discounted net rent. Signing snapshots the
applied rule revision and values; invoices use the saved net rent and never read
mutable discount rules. See [policy, rounding and verification](../../docs/long-term-discounts.md).
