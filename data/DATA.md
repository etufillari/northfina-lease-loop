# The data pack

Everything here is **synthetic**. The brands, people, companies and business IDs are made up, the e-mail addresses use `example.com`, and the 2027 VAT change and CO₂ factors are fictional. Use, change or extend it however you like.

Typed loaders and Zod schemas for every file live in `src/data/`. Read those for the exact field types.

## Conventions

- **Money is integer euro cents.** `389000` means €3,890.00. Prices are **net (VAT excluded)** unless a field says otherwise.
- **Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.** `valid_to: null` means "still valid".
- **Percentages are plain numbers.** `25.5` means 25.5 %.

## Worked example: the monthly price

`ebike-003` (Nordvolt Trail 500), 36 months, no down payment, signed on 5 Nov 2026:

1. List price on 5 Nov 2026 (price list v1): **389000** cents.
2. Financed amount = 389000 − 0 = **389000**. That's in band **B** (200000–999999).
3. Factor for band B, 36 months: **0.027584**.
4. Monthly net rent = 389000 × 0.027584 = 10730.18 → **10730** cents (rounding is your design decision; document it).
5. VAT on an invoice dated in Nov 2026: 25.5 % → 2736.15 → **2736** cents. Invoice total: **13466** cents.
6. Buyout at the end of 36 months: 15 % of financed = **58350** cents.

The factor already includes interest and the buyout at the end. You don't need to derive it, but the band's `annual_interest_percent` is there if you want to discount money over time (for example, for a fair early exit).

## Second-life prices

Relisting uses the asset's market value with no markup. Age is counted in full months from the first recorded lease start, or from 1 July of the model year for an imported return. The starting price is the first lease's locked net list price. For an imported return, use the list valid on the age reference date or the earliest recorded list price if there is no price on that date.

The valuation applies the interpolated residual curve, condition after refurbishment, and the capped usage adjustment to the starting price. It rounds half up once, to cents. An amount below the smallest finance band cannot be relisted. Signing records the second-life price as its source and locks the amounts in the contract.

## Waiting-list offers

Eligible offers meet the category, condition, monthly net rent budget, and deadline. Mandatory work on an already acceptable item is viable when the resulting market value covers its cost; it need not increase resale value. Optional upgrades must recover at least as much as that mandatory-work baseline (or the untreated item when no acceptable baseline exists). The matcher offers the least costly viable option that qualifies. It ranks by earliest deadline, then lower refurbishment cost, then `signed_up_on`, then entry ID. The data pack has no work durations, so the planned ready date is today or the current lease's end, whichever is later.

An active offer holds the asset for that entry through `needed_by`. The item stays in the returns workflow so its work can be recorded. Public relisting is blocked during the hold. The provider can prepare a placement for the identified recipient with `waitingListEntryId` on the relist command. That placement may use the recipient’s minimum condition, including fair, but still requires all mandatory work. Imported entries first need a `renterId`; existing customer entries cannot be reassigned. Only that customer can sign, within the offer deadline, term and net budget. Signing consumes the hold atomically with reserving the asset.

## Rules for `ask_when` in questions.json

`ask_when` is a list of conditions, and **all** must be true for the question to be asked. An empty list means "always ask".

```json
{ "field": "customer_type", "op": "in", "value": ["company"] }
{ "field": "financed_amount_cents", "op": "gte", "value": 1000000 }
{ "field": "answers.q_can_sign", "op": "in", "value": ["no"] }
```

Fields: `customer_type`, `category`, `financed_amount_cents`, `term_months`, `answers.<question id>`. Ops: `in`, `gte`, `lte`. The engine, and what happens when an earlier answer changes, is up to you.

## Things that are deliberately tricky

We're not listing them all. A few to start with:

- Two laptops cost exactly €1,999.99 and €2,000.00, either side of a band boundary.
- One item is too cheap to lease, and one is too expensive.
- One item is reserved and can't be leased.
- One business ID has a wrong check digit. Finnish Y-tunnus check digits follow a public algorithm.
- Two waiting-list entries are identical except for one thing.
