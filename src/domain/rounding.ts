// Every amount that is not already whole cents (rent = financed × factor, VAT = net × rate,
// buyout = financed × percent) is rounded ONCE, at the moment it becomes a cent amount,
// half up: 0.5 cent and more goes up, less than 0.5 cent goes down. All our amounts are
// non-negative, so "half up" and "half away from zero" are the same thing here.
//
// To keep that exact, we never multiply cents by a floating-point rate. Rates are first
// turned into whole numbers of a fixed unit (millionths, tenths of a percent), multiplied
// as integers, and divided once with integer rounding.
