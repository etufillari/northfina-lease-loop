# Participant and contract tooling

Issue #5 provides backend/domain tooling. Profile/login layouts, visual components,
notification editors and the new profile screen are deferred to the UI workstream.
Existing sign/contract pages have only thin adapters for principal scope, locale and PDF.

## Identity

There is one demo identity: the name the visitor gives on the sign-in page (issue #1,
`src/app/[locale]/sign-in/`). It is stored in main's HTTP-only `lease-loop-name` cookie
(`src/server/demo-cookie.ts`) and cleaned by `normaliseDemoName`. This is intentionally
mock identity selection, not authentication; signing out clears the cookie.

Each name maps to one stable `DemoUser` row, the participant record that contracts and
later lifecycle records link to. The canonical key (`DemoUser.canonicalUsername`) is
computed by `demoParticipantName` in `src/domain/demo-participant.ts`:
`normaliseDemoName`, then Unicode NFKC, whitespace collapsed again, then lower case. So
" AINO ", "ＡＩＮＯ" and "aino" are the same participant. The display name keeps the
cleaned spelling of the first sign-in. A name seen for the first time creates its
DemoUser with an audit row (`demo_user.created`); concurrent first sign-ins resolve to
one row and one audit entry.

Server components use `currentPrincipal()` from `src/server/current-principal.ts` (it
reads the name with `readDemoName()`). Route handlers use `requirePrincipal(db, request)`
or `principalFromRequest(db, request)` from `src/server/mock-users.ts`, which read the
same cookie from the request's Cookie header. Tests and scripts that call handlers
directly build that header with `demoNameCookieHeader(name)`. Replace those adapters with
proper login later; participant relationships use stable IDs.
Never use the applicant's free-text `Contract.actor` as an authorization key, and a typed
name never bypasses the server's application approval or signatory checks.

Run `npm run db:setup` to initialize the synthetic participants/owners. Sign-in names
match persona ID suffixes (`aino`, `mikko`, etc.). The item owners are the dealer-side
demo providers from `src/server/providers.ts` with the same IDs and seed ownership:
`kettu` (Kettu Mobility Oy), `pelto` (Pelto Agri Rental Oy) and Aino, who owns ebike-005
and can be renter/provider across different agreements. The seeder does not attribute
historical contracts to a user by matching their display names.

## Query endpoints

- `GET /api/profile?filter=all&sort=start_desc`: scoped incoming/outgoing contracts,
  summary cards, selected query and reporting date. Filters: all/current/ended. Sort:
  start_asc/start_desc/end_asc/end_desc. Overall summaries do not follow row filters.
- `GET /api/contracts/:id`: participant-scoped immutable contract, lines/lifecycle and
  original PDF metadata/download URL. Foreign IDs return the same missing-contract result.
- `GET /documents/contracts/:id`: saved PDF bytes for either participant. This binary
  route is outside `/api`; JSON APIs use the standard envelope. It checks stored digest,
  sets the signing language and disables shared caching.

Pure classification/filter/sort/summary functions and exported types are in
`src/domain/profile-leases.ts`. Start is inclusive; end is exclusive. An expired but
unreturned contract is temporally ended, not automatically operationally completed.
Active costs/income use locked monthly net rent, with per-contract date-effective VAT.

## Signing and originals

`POST /api/contracts` retains the existing lease/answer/expected-price fields and now
accepts `locale` (en/fi/sv/et, default en). A demo sign-in name and a configured
provider owner are required. Approval and company signatory checks still run on the
server. The signed-in participant is linked separately from the approved applicant name.

`signApplication` delegates to the existing audited signer. The PDF is prepared before
the transaction; availability/provider is checked again while reserving. Contract,
line snapshot, initial lifecycle, original PDF and audit row commit together. Rendering
or audit failure leaves no partial signed contract/reservation/document.

The renderer uses bundled DejaVu Sans (license in assets/fonts) for Finnish, Swedish
and Estonian text. It saves one signing-language original, template version, real
generation timestamp and SHA-256 digest. Later price/template/UI-language changes
do not replace the saved bytes. The document explicitly identifies mock signing.

`signContract` is the low-level trusted service retained for existing integrations/tests;
HTTP signing always goes through `signApplication` and `requirePrincipal`. New public
routes must never call the low-level signer to bypass application approval.

## Compatible legacy and lifecycle integration

Existing financial scalar fields remain intact. Normal leases get one ContractLine;
future bundles can extend this to multiple lines under the same agreement. Mutable
ContractLifecycle is separate from the locked financial snapshot; #6 owns exit transitions.

Trusted operator services in `src/server/legacy-contracts.ts` provide explicit audited
participant mapping and exact line backfill. They have no public endpoint. Mapping
requires known distinct IDs and refuses to overwrite a mapping. Line backfill copies
saved amounts without consulting current price lists. Neither helper invents an original
PDF or backdates one. Ambiguous legacy ownership and missing originals remain explicit.

For the historical discount-migration table rebuild that removed nullable participant
columns, server startup restores a missing pair only when a stable renter ID appears in a
`contract.signed` audit entry and the immutable `ContractProvider` link points to an existing
provider and participant. The update and recovery audit commit together. Human names and
ambiguous records are left unmapped for explicit operator review.

Future notification preferences/inbox tooling belongs to #10 and can attach to these
contract/principal IDs. Return/refurbishment management belongs to #12. No messaging,
reminder worker, rating form or polished dashboard is implemented by this issue.
